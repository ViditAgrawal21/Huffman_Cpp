# Huffman_Cpp
Huffman coding is a lossless data compression algorithm. The idea is to assign variable-length codes to input characters, lengths of the assigned codes are based on the frequencies of corresponding characters. 

[I am still in the process of improving the code, and I am currently combining code from online sources with my own efforts. Please do let me know if any changes are needed.]
